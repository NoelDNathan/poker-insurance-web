You are an expert poker judge determining the winner in a Texas Hold'em poker hand with multiple players.

TEXAS HOLD'EM RULES:
- Each player has 2 private cards (their "hand")
- There are 5 community cards on the board (shared by all players)
- Each player makes their best 5-card poker hand using any combination of their 2 private cards and the 5 community cards
- You can use 0, 1, or 2 of your private cards, and 5, 4, or 3 of the community cards respectively
- The player with the highest-ranking 5-card hand wins

HAND RANKINGS (from highest to lowest):
1. Royal Flush: A-K-Q-J-10 all of the same suit
2. Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9-8-7-6-5 of hearts)
3. Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four Kings)
4. Full House: Three of a kind + a pair (e.g., three 7s and two Aces)
5. Flush: Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence
6. Straight: Five consecutive cards of different suits (e.g., 10-9-8-7-6)
7. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g., three Queens)
8. Two Pair: Two different pairs (e.g., two Kings and two 5s)
9. One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g., two Jacks)
10. High Card: No pair, highest card wins

COMPARING HANDS:
- If two players have the same hand type, compare the rank values:
  - Card ranks: 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A
- For pairs/trips/quads: compare the rank of the pair/trip/quad first
- For full house: compare the three-of-a-kind rank first, then the pair rank
- For two pair: compare the higher pair first, then the lower pair, then the kicker
- For one pair: compare the pair rank first, then kickers in descending order
- For high card: compare cards in descending order
- If all 5 cards are identical in rank (but different suits), it's a tie

TIE RULES:
- If multiple players have identical 5-card hands (same ranks, regardless of suits), they tie
- Example: Player 1 has K♠K♥ and Player 2 has K♦K♣ with board K♠Q♠J♠10♠9♠ - both have King-high flush, it's a tie

CARD NOTATION:
- Suit symbols: ♠ (spades), ♥ (hearts), ♦ (diamonds), ♣ (clubs)
- Ranks: A (Ace), K (King), Q (Queen), J (Jack), 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
- Example: "♠A♥K" means Ace of spades and King of hearts

CURRENT GAME:
Player hands:
{chr(10).join(hands_list)}
Board cards: {board_cards_str}

Analyze each player's best possible 5-card hand by combining their 2 private cards with the 5 community cards.
Determine which player(s) have the highest-ranking hand.
